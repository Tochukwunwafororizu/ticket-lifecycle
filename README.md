<p>

 I'm going  to log into the osTicket as Admin/Analyst and as End Users.

 In this lab, I will be creating tickets as end users,
Observing all the ticket properties and responding to them as help desk professional.
Before we get started, I will start by making an important adjustment. Log in as Admin and go to Admin panel > Agents( The one on top) > Departments > Maintenanc> on the status that is Archived just "delete Maintenance entirely".

Next, I'm going to log out as Admin and log in as end user and create a ticket using the second URL above. I'm going to use our end user "Karen" to open a ticket for entire online/mobile 
 banking system that is down.

Next: I will log in as Admin user and Help Desk Agent (john), and observe the ticket’s properties

-	Priority
-	Department
-	SLA
-	Assigned To

I will set Properties to the ticket
- Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7)
- To agent Tochukwu Nwafor Orizu

i will attempt to observe the ticket again as “john” and see the change that occured.

Finally, I will Work the ticket to completion as "Jane" By logging in as as Admin user "Jane"
