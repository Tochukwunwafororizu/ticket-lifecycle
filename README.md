<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>

 I am going to use the two URL to log into the osTicket as Admin/Analyst and as End Users ( Same URL  previously used).

- http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php
- http://localhost/osTicket
- In this lab, I will be creating tickets as end users
Observing all the ticket properties and responding to them as help desk professionals.
Before we get started, I will start by making an important adjustment. Log in as Admin and go to Admin panel - Agents( The one on top) -Departments - Maintenance - on the status that is Archived just "delete Maintenance entirely".

Next I am going to log out as Admin and log in as end user and create a ticket using the second URL above. I am going to use our end user "Karen" to open a ticket for entire online/mobile 
 banking system that is down.

</p>
Next: I will log in as Admin user and Help Desk Agent (john), and observe the ticket’s properties

-	Priority
-	Department
-	SLA
-	Assigned To

I will set Properties to the ticket
- Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7)
- To agent Tochukwu Nwafor Orizu

And i will attempt to observe the ticket again as “john” and see the change that occured.

Work the ticket to completion as "Jane" By logging in as as Admin user "Jane"
